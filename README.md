The protein–protein interaction data can be represented as a network whose nodes are proteins,
and they are connected by edges if the corresponding proteins interact. Previous studies have shown
that these networks are highly heterogeneous, containing both a large number of proteins with few
interaction partners, but also many highly connected ‘ hub’ proteins. In our project, we manage
to extract information out of the protein-protein interaction data and provide users with queries.
